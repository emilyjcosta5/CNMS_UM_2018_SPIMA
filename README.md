# pyUSID Tutorial

We present a set of jupyter notebooks and presentations that go over the
basics of:

-   the [Universal Spectroscopy and Imaging Data
    (USID)](https://pycroscopy.github.io/pyUSID/data_format.html) model
    and
-   [pyUSID](https://pycroscopy.github.io/pyUSID/about.html) - the
    python interface to storing, interacting with, and visualizing USID
    files
    
This material was developed as part of the [2018 CNMS User Meeting workshop](./CNMS_UM_Workshop_schedule.md)

## Prerequisites

-   Familiarity with the basics. See our [list of
    tutorials](https://pycroscopy.github.io/pyUSID/external_guides.html):
    -   starting and operating [Jupyter notebooks](./00_a_jupyter_notebooks.ipynb)
    -   basic concepts of python
        - variables
        - lists and dictionaries
        - if else statements
        - for loops
        - creating and using functions
    -   numerical analysis using [numpy](./00_c_numpy.ipynb)
-   An environment to run the jupyter notebooks:
    1.  **(Recommended)** - [Azure
        notebooks](./azure_notebooks_setup.md)
        
    2.  [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pycroscopy/pyUSID_Tutorial/master)
        - The link above should launch a container via binder. Please be patient

    3.  Local installation of python
        -   Follow these instructions to install
            [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and
            [pyUSID](https://pycroscopy.github.io/pyUSID/install.html) on your own laptop
