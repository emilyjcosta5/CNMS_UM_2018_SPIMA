# Imaging and Spectral Data Analysis in Python

We present a set of jupyter notebooks and presentations that go over the
basics of:

- Image and spectral data analysis in Python 
- [USID](https://pycroscopy.github.io/pyUSID/data_format.html), [pyUSID](https://pycroscopy.github.io/pyUSID/about.html), 
  and [pycroscopy](https://pycroscopy.github.io/pycroscopy/about.html) as tools for analyzing large and multidimensional imaging / spectroscopy datasets 
    
This material was developed as part of the [2018 CNMS User Meeting](./CNMS_UM_Workshop_schedule.md)

## Software
You need to be able to run some example code + examples to get the most out of this workshop. 

- Follow [these instructions](https://pycroscopy.github.io/pycroscopy/install.html) to install Anaconda + 
  pycroscopy on your own laptop
- Also please install pyUSID via: ``pip install pyUSID`` just like how you installed pycroscopy

## Prerequisites
**Please see above Software section above to install the necessary software**

You are recommended to be familiar with **all** of the below topics before beginning with the workshop
1.   starting and operating [Jupyter notebooks](./01_jupyter_notebooks.ipynb)
2.   basic concepts of [python](./02_python.ipynb)
3.   numerical analysis using [numpy](./03_numpy.ipynb)

See our [list of tutorials](https://pycroscopy.github.io/pyUSID/external_guides.html) for more information
    
## Getting started
1. If you had trouble installing the software (above), click [here](./online_environments.md) and follow the instructions on that page
2. If you have installed the necessary software on your computer:
    1. Download the files from this GitHub repository (one time): 
        1. click on the green ``Clone or download`` button
        2. Click on ``Download ZIP``
        3. Download the zip file to your Documents / Downloads / Desktop
        4. Unzip the zip file
    2. Start a terminal (every time):
        1. Windows users: Click on ``Start`` >> ``Anaconda3`` >> ``Anaconda Prompt``
        2. Mac / Linux users: Open ``Terminal``. You can find it by holding down your ``Command`` and ``Space`` key and typing ``Terminal`` in the search bar that pops up.
    3. In the ``Terminal`` or ``Anaconda Prompt``, type ``jupyter notebook`` and press the ``Enter`` or ``Return`` key
    4. If everything happened correctly, a new tab should pop up on your default browser showing familiar folders such as ``Desktop``, ``Documents``, etc. Navigate to the folder (e.g. - ``Desktop``) where you unzipped the zip file in step (i) 
3. Navigate to the ``index.ipynb`` file which should look [like this](./index.ipynb)
