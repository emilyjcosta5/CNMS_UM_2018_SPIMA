# Imaging and Spectral Data Analysis in Python

We present a set of jupyter notebooks and presentations that go over the
basics of:

- Image and spectral data analysis in Python 
- [USID](https://pycroscopy.github.io/pyUSID/data_format.html), [pyUSID](https://pycroscopy.github.io/pyUSID/about.html), 
  and [pycroscopy](https://pycroscopy.github.io/pycroscopy/about.html) as tools for analyzing large and multidimensional imaging / spectroscopy datasets 
    
This material was developed as part of the [2018 CNMS User Meeting workshop](./CNMS_UM_Workshop_schedule.md)

## Software
You need to be able to run some example code + examples to get the most out of this workshop. 

- Follow these instructions to install Anaconda + 
  [pycroscopy](https://pycroscopy.github.io/pycroscopy/install.html) on your own laptop
- Also please install pyUSID via: ``pip install pyUSID`` just like how you installed pycroscopy

## Prerequisites
**Please see above Software section above to install the necessary software**

You are recommended to be familiar with **all** of the below topics before beginning with the workshop
1.   starting and operating [Jupyter notebooks](./01_jupyter_notebooks.ipynb)
2.   basic concepts of [python](./02_python.ipynb)
