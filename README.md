# pyUSID Tutorial

We present a set of jupyter notebooks and presentations that go over the
basics of:

-   the [Universal Spectroscopy and Imaging Data
    (USID)](https://pycroscopy.github.io/pyUSID/data_format.html) model
    and
-   [pyUSID](https://pycroscopy.github.io/pyUSID/about.html) - the
    python interface to storing, interacting with, and visualizing USID
    files
    
This material was developed as part of the [2018 CNMS User Meeting workshop](./CNMS_UM_Workshop_schedule.md)

## Prerequisites
### 1. Basics of Scientific Python
You are recommended to be familiar with **all** of the below topics before beginning with the workshop
1.   starting and operating [Jupyter notebooks](./00_a_jupyter_notebooks.ipynb)
2.   basic concepts of python
    - variables
    - lists and dictionaries
    - if else statements
    - for loops
    - creating and using functions
3.   numerical analysis using [numpy](./00_c_numpy.ipynb)

See our [list of tutorials](https://pycroscopy.github.io/pyUSID/external_guides.html) for more information
### 2. Environment
Choose one of the following:
-  **(Recommended)** - Azure notebooks
    1. You will need to [sign up](https://signup.live.com/?wa=wsignin1.0&rpsnv=13&ct=1533149109&rver=6.7.6643.0&wp=MBI_SSL&wreply=https%3a%2f%2faccount.microsoft.com%2fauth%2fcomplete-signin%3fru%3dhttps%253A%252F%252Faccount.microsoft.com%252F%253Frefd%253Daccount.microsoft.com%2526refp%253Dsignedout-index&id=292666&lw=1&fl=easi2&pcexp=true&uictx=me&contextid=D0A988B000A50828&bk=1533149128&uiflavor=web&uaid=098dd33703314790a45fcfb799fd93d3&mkt=EN-US&lc=1033&lic=1) for a Microsoft (Outlook, Hotmail, ...) account if you don't already have one.
    2. Once you are logged in, click [here](https://notebooks.azure.com/ssomnath/libraries/pyusidtutorial)
    3. Next, click on the ``Clone`` button (just above the search bar) to make your own copy of the project
    4. Once your copy of the project has been created, click on the ``Run`` button along the same line as the ``Clone`` button
    5. You should be directed to a familiar Jupyter notebook server page.
    
-  Binder
    - The benefit of Binder is that one does not need a Microsoft account, 
      but the drawback is that your solutions / edits will be lost if you close the browser tab(s)
    - Click [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pycroscopy/pyUSID_Tutorial/master) to launch the jupyter notebook server.
      This will take a while so please be patient.

-  Local installation of python
    - Follow these instructions to install 
      [pyUSID](https://pycroscopy.github.io/pyUSID/install.html) on your own laptop
    - We cannot promise support for this method during live workshops.
