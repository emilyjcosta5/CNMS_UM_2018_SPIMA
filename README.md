# pyUSID Tutorial

We present a set of jupyter notebooks and presentations that go over the
basics of:

-   the [Universal Spectroscopy and Imaging Data
    (USID)](https://pycroscopy.github.io/pyUSID/data_format.html) model
    and
-   [pyUSID](https://pycroscopy.github.io/pyUSID/about.html) - the
    python interface to storing, interacting with, and visualizing USID
    files

## Prerequisites

-   Knowledge of and familiarity with the basics. See our [list of
    tutorials](https://pycroscopy.github.io/pyUSID/external_guides.html):

        notebooks](./azure_notebooks_setup.md)
        
    2.  [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pycroscopy/pyUSID_Tutorial/master)
        - The link above should launch a container via binder. Please be patient

    3.  Local installation of python
        -   Follow these instructions to install
            [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and
