## Getting to the workshop

### On-site participants
The workshop will be held at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Visistors may find these [maps and directions](https://www.ornl.gov/content/maps-and-directions) helpful to get to ORNL.

Once inside ORNL, please drive to the [Spllation Neutron Source (SNS)](https://neutrons.ornl.gov/sns) - building 8600, which is located in the top right 
of [this map](https://www.ornl.gov/sites/default/files/05-01786-outsideMC-.pdf). Please also refer to this slightly 
[more detailed map](https://www.ornl.gov/sites/default/files/sns_hfir_visitor_map.pdf) of the SNS complex.

The workshop will be held in conference rooms C-156 and C-152 of the SNS.
