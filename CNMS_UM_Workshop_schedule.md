**You are highly encouraged to attend the follow-on** [workshop on Machine Learning](https://cnmsusermeeting.ornl.gov/files/2018/03/MachineLearning_WT_081518.pdf) **on August 15th.**

## Before the workshop
1. Please fill out this quick [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeR5aB-iMxeCUyjk4t2hNhFKYy8ikBIqVPOZyzVeAbWXHvZ-w/viewform?usp=sf_link) about your comfort levels
2. Please follow [these instructions](./README.md#software) to install the necessary software. 
   Due to the large number of attendees, the WiFi may be slower than ideal. 
   **Therefore, please install the software on your laptop BEFORE the workshop**.
   If you are having trouble installing the software, please [get in touch with us](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pycroscopy). 
   Those coming on-site to the workshop are recommended to arrive early to the workshop so that one of the organizers can help you
3. Please familiarize yourself with the [basics](./README.md#prerequisites)

## Getting to the workshop

### On-site participants
The workshop will be held at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Visitors may find these [maps and directions](https://www.ornl.gov/content/maps-and-directions) helpful to get to ORNL.

Once inside ORNL, please drive to the [Spllation Neutron Source (SNS)](https://neutrons.ornl.gov/sns) - building 8600, which is located in the top right 
of [this map](https://www.ornl.gov/sites/default/files/05-01786-outsideMC-.pdf). Please also refer to this slightly 
[more detailed map](https://www.ornl.gov/sites/default/files/sns_hfir_visitor_map.pdf) of the SNS complex.

The workshop will be held in conference rooms C-156 and C-152 of the SNS. 

### Remote participants
